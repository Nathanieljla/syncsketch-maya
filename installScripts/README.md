##  Creating the Drag&Drop installer:
`installGui.py` is a single file script, with ressources included as base64 format. After your modification's are done, make sure to run `python makeMelRunner.py` to generate the `installCrossPlatformGUI.mel` file. Test it and put it to the release as a binary.
