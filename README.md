#### This fork supports python3 and Maya's module system to keep syncSketch specific content isolated and easier to manage.

#### A thorough testing of this is still needed, however basic functionality seems to be working without issues.

This is a fork. Please see https://github.com/syncsketch/syncsketch-maya for more info.

Known Issues:
1. grease pencil was replaced in 2023, so downloading notes doesn't work.
